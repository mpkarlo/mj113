# Mini Jam 113: Final Boss
Mini jam is a 72-hour-long video game development jam that occurs every two 
weeks on Itch.io.

A required limitation is announced as soon as the jam starts to spice things up. 
Remember, limitation breeds creativity. You get the theme early, so you can plan 
ahead, Just keep in mind that you may have to change your idea when the 
limitation is revealed. This jam's theme is Final Boss. Remember, theme is 
purely inspirational and not required. Feel free to interpret it however you 
want.

No worries if you can't finish your game on time, you can submit late at anytime 
during the jam's voting period.

## Game Concept

The player controls a spaceship locked in combat with a space station. The
space station will lash out waves of defenses against the lone ship and the
player must learn to cope with each.

- **Movement** - The player should be able to smoothly move his ship in 
  8-directions. The ship should take some time to accelerate and decelerate 
  after input. Movement is fastest in the forward (up) direction, and 
  slowest in the reverse (down). Lateral movement (side-to-side) is 
  somewhere in between. The player should also be able to activate booster 
  jets that allow quick burst movement in a single direction.
- **Energy** - The player has a reserve of energy used by his ship. This 
  energy is consumed based on the use of boosters, abilities and weapons. 
  Different subsystems consume energy at different rates. The player must 
  learn to manage his energy economy to be effective.

## Limitation

The limitation is a special condition that your game must follow, but is open to 
interpretation. If you are unsure if your idea doesn't fit the limitation,  
just remember that everyone will interpret it differently.

### Limitation: Stuck In A Loop

This limitation is more of a theme than any hard rules. Something somehow must 
be stuck in a loop- A time loop, or some physical loop. This of course can also 
be applied to narrative elements in your project. Get creative with it!

## Rating

At the end of the Jam, there will be a rating period that lasts 5 days. 

### Your game will be rated on:

- **Enjoyment** - How much you enjoyed your time with the game.        
- **Concept** - How interesting or unique the main focus of the game was.           
- **Presentation** - How well executed the main focus of the game was.           
- **Use of limitation** - How well the game incorporated the given limitation.

Keep in mind that the theme is purely for inspiration, and you should not rate a 
game differently based on how well the theme was followed.
